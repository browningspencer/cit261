Brother Klein,

Previously I submitted sandbox code for each of the following topics to you. I have made the changes you suggested and am now requesting that my fluency be recorded and moved from Strongly Disagree to Disagree.

	-Local Storage API, Storing and Retrieving Simple Data, Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects
	-Using XMLHTTPRequest to Consume a JSON Web Service
	-HTML5 Tags - Video, Audio, Canvas, etc.

I also am providing you evidence of my professionalism as described in the 'Being Successful by being Assessed' portion of the course description and in the course rubric.

	1. Interacting Professionally with the Instructor: I have asked questions of you regarding these three topics, and have kept you up-to-date on the 	schedule changes our team made since I last claimed fluency. One question I asked was, "I've been working on learning to use XMLHTTPRequest. I think I understand how it works, but how do I access the data I get back when using an API like snapChat's?"

	2. Interacting Helpfully and Professionally with Other Teams: As you can see from this link to a Google+ group discussion, I shared with another team what I previously learned about using Video tags to record videos.

	3. Supporting the Team by Teaching, etc. - Here is a link to a Google+ hangout where I am teaching my team about JavaScript loops and arrays. You can hear me teaching at the 3:20 time stamp in the video.

	-Self-Reflection/Meta-Cognition: I had a meta-cognative moment this week. I was in sacrament meeting listening to a ward member speak about the importance of scripture reading. This is something I have had trouble doing consistantly. I started wondering why. Then I started pondering, "Why do I think scripture reading isn't important enough to do every day?" I realized I was thinking of scripture reading as being an extra thing I should do when I already have a busy schedule with my family, my job, and my church calling. I realized and have now started to think of scripture reading as the foundation of anything I want or need to accomplish. It isn't optional to me anymore. My thinking has changed.

	-Team's Agile Methodology: Our team is using the scrum method. Since I last submitted an assessment request I've been participating in our scrum daily standup meetings, working on my assigned scrum sprint, and attending and participating in our other team meetings.
	
	-Professional Scheduling Group: At this point I've met all of the scheduled commitments I've made to the team for delivery of teaching and code. The schedule has had to be modified a little because it took me a little more time to understand Local Storage than I thought it would. You can see the schedule I'm working against and the dates I've delivered what I was responsible for to my team at this link.

Thank you.
