Brother Klein,

This is a first-time submission. I am requesting that my fluency be recorded and moved from Strongly Disagree to Disagree in the following topic:

	-Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Variables, Parameters, Arrays, Associative Arrays

Here is a link to my code:

I also am providing you evidence of my professionalism as described in the 'Being Successful by being Assessed' portion of the course description and in the course rubric.

	1. Interacting Professionally with the Instructor - I contacted you to get added to one of the teams a little late in the semester because I got started on the class late. I am striving to follow all the correct procedures in submitting code and requesting an assessment from you. 

	2. Interacting Helpfully and Professionally with Other Teams - I have strived to ask clarifying questions with other teams, and being active on the class discussions

	3. Supporting the Team by Teaching, etc. - My team has met together and we have posted a link to our meeting on the class discussion boards. I have striven to be helpful to my team in sharing what I've learned as to how to be successful in the class.

	-Self-Reflection/Meta-Cognition: 

	-Team's Agile Methodology: Our team is using a schedule to keep track of who is submitting code when, and when we are doing our presentations on subjects. I've strived to have good communication with my group.
	
	-Professional Scheduling Group: I am a little late getting started on my first time submits, but I have made sure to adjust my schedule to reflect that. It's taken me and my team longer than expected to get started as we have been striving to figure out what is expected of us.

Thank you. 
Signed, 

Spencer Browning
