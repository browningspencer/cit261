This is an exercise to practice using github again.

For the Nasty paths, use try and catches so you can run the bad code without killing it

"website"/sandbox_wk1.html

// sandbox_wk1.html would be the file that you are submitting with all of your code in it.

Pretty much copy the submit request on the google doc and just change out some stuff
